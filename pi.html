      How to setup a Raspberry Pi.
    </h1>
    <ol>
    	<li>Get a Raspberry Pi, a Micro SD Card, and a power supply (yes, there is a specific power supply needed for the Pi. A simple micro usb cable usually doesn't provide enough power usually).</li>
      <li>Download Raspian <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Here</a> and Etcher <a href="etcher.io">Here</a> on a normal PC/Laptop.</li>
      <li>Connect the Micro SD Card to the PC/Laptop and flash the Raspbian image to the Micro SD Card using Etcher.</li>
      <li>After it says it succeeded (if it failed, try again), eject the Micro SD Card and put it into the Raspberry PI.</li>
      <li>Plug in the raspberry pi using the power supply.</li>
      <li>If a green light turns on, then it successfully booted.</li>
      <li>If you want to see the desktop, plug a HDMI cable into the Raspberry Pi.</li>
      <li>When finished, if you can, press the shutdown button in the desktop. If not, don't worry. After turning it off (or not), just unplug it. (It's designed to be unplugged to turn it off, it won't hurt it.)</li>
